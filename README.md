# Urban_Biker-DecathlonCoach

This project is a converter from the output files -gpx and svgs- of Urban Biker app to the format that the DecathlonCoach app can handle as input.

Some packages need to be installed with pip install:
    pip install gpxpy
    pip install svgpathtools

Limitations:
    Though cadance data can be saved in the output file of the program and DecathlonCoach does not hang on such file as input, this data is still not shown in DecathlonCoach training sessions. "Geonaute Request # 98977" is opened to clarify it.
